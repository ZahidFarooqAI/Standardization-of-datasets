# Standardization-of-datasets
Standardization is a preprocessing step in machine learning where we transform each feature so that:  Mean = 0 (centered around zero)  Standard deviation = 1 (same spread for all features)  This ensures that all features are on the same scale, preventing features with large numeric ranges from dominating model training.
